## Short Description:
# Problem Statement:
Nowadays Global Warming is a very big threat to the Earth and one of its major cause is increase in CO2 level. 

# Solution Statement:
A reason to the increased CO2 level is deforestation so in this project we are promoting afforestation and grass planting.
Through our project, we are aiming to predict number of trees and area of grass to be planted in a particular region to reduce the CO2 level of that region.
